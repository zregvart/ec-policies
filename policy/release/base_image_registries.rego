# title: Base image comes from permitted registry
# description: >-
#   The base images used when building a container image must come from a known set
#   of trusted registries to reduce potential supply chain attacks. By default this
#   policy defines trusted registries as registries that are fully maintained by Red
#   Hat and only contain content produced by Red Hat. The list of permitted registries
#   can be customized by setting the `allowed_registry_prefixes` list in the rule data.
# custom:
#   short_name: base_image_permitted
#   failure_msg: Base image %q is from a disallowed registry
#   solution: >-
#     Make sure the image used in each task comes from a trusted registry. The list of
#     trusted registries is a configurable xref:ec-cli:ROOT:configuration.adoc#_data_sources[data source].
